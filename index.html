        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I am Naydeen, a nineteen year-old college student who is interested in joining different fields of work until I find the career that suits me best. I am a person who enjoys immersing myself in diverse groups of individuals. Learning from and working with others is a key value that I hold. I always hope to contribute to spaces that amplify the voices of all in a respectfuk, compassionate way. I enjoy taking the skills I learn in life and applying them to my professional life as well. Whether that is the leadership I learned from years of playing sports or the patience I learned from student mentorship, I strive to use all skills in my arsenal in order to achieve both individual and group success.<br><br>

        I am always willing to adapt to the needs of the business in many sectors. I am open to learning any positions or skills necessary to my personal advancement within the company. My advanced knowledge of various computer applications increases my efficiency when interacting with guests and peers alike. I have experienced multiple positions in both my jobs and academia that have prepared me to enter any job with teamwork in mind along with empathy and patience for any and all persons whom I interact with. I have experience with different software and operating systems across a multitude of devices. I have taken multiple courses on desktop computers where I learned the basics of HTML coding along with software such as Office Suite and Google Suite. With the needs of any job being ever-changing, I am willing to adapt to any new challenges that I will face. My workstyle is suited to various environments, demonstrated by my active participation in group projects with diverse individuals throughout my academic career. The computer applications I use most include the Office Suite, Google Suite, and various internet browsers. However, I am extremely proficient in data entry and organization using Excel.
<br><br>

        I curently hold my diploma as my highest degree earned, however, I am currently in the process of attending University in order to earn a Bachelor of Arts. I am currently attending the University of California in Riverside as a graduate of the class of 2024. I am currently majoring in Political Science and am planning on emphasizing the American Politics aspect of the major. I have also began the process of adding a minor along to my major, Education. I decided on education due to the fact that I would like to teach American Goverment to high school students. I find teaching to be an immense passion of mine. This is mostly because I want to pay it forward because of the teachers who insipired me to pursue higher education; because of them, I was able to participatate in a rigorros education and become published in research by the time I graduated high school. Above all, I hope to also inspire others to reach for their highestg self regardless of the backgrounds they come from, especially black and brown teens in low-income areas.
